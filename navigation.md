# Navigation Rules

Navigation in the PWA is role-driven, not document-driven.

Rules:
- Users always start by selecting a role
- Roles determine which playbooks are visible
- Playbooks remain autonomous and keep their internal structure
- The PWA shell never contains playbook-specific logic or styling
- Navigation is derived from playbook metadata only

This document defines behaviour, not implementation.
